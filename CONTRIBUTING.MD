# Contributing
Thank you for watching that, but I don't need contributors now. \
This guidelines created for further contributing and as reference material for me.

## Issues
When you create issue, ** please **:
* Assign developers which must complete the task, if any.
* Add issue to project, if any.
* Add issue to milestone, if any.

## Commiting
When you commit, ** please **:
* Sign your commit.
* Reference to issue (if any).

Commit message must be informative, but short as that can. \
The most simple way is copy issue name.
